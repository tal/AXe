## Install

```bash
brew tap cameroncooke/axe
brew install axe
```

Or install in one command:

```bash
brew install cameroncooke/axe/axe
```

Verify the CLI:

```bash
axe --help
axe list-simulators
```

## Install the AI skill

Install the bundled AXe skill from this repository's marketplace.

Claude Code:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add cameroncooke/AXe
claude plugin install axe@axe
```

Codex:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add cameroncooke/AXe
codex plugin add axe@axe
```

> [!NOTE]
> The marketplace references the existing case-sensitive `Skills/CLI` path directly. It does not include a lowercase `skills/` compatibility symlink, so clients or filesystems that require the conventional lowercase path are unsupported.

## Xcode compatibility

AXe supports Xcode 26 and Xcode 27. Xcode 27 simulator automation uses Device Hub; Simulator.app is not required.

Release artifacts are built once with the Xcode version selected by the release environment and run unchanged with either supported Xcode selected. Compatibility was validated with Xcode 26.5 (build `17F42`) and iOS 26.5 (`23F77`), and with Xcode 27 Beta 3 (build `27A5218g`) and iOS 27 (`24A5380g`).

AXe builds IDB from the immutable fork revision configured in `scripts/build.sh`, based on a verified upstream IDB revision. The build does not apply a local patch queue.

## E2E development

`make e2e` rebuilds the local IDB XCFrameworks, builds AXe, and runs the simulator tests with the Xcode selected by `DEVELOPER_DIR` or `xcode-select`. XcodeGen is required to generate the IDB projects. When Xcode 27 is selected, the runner starts Device Hub, chooses an available iOS 27 iPhone 17 Pro, and boots it with `simctl`.

To validate a release payload unchanged under another supported Xcode, first build the test bundle with that Xcode, then run `AXE_BIN_PATH=/path/to/release/axe ./test-runner.sh --tests-only`. The supplied executable must retain its packaged frameworks beside it.

## Basic usage

```bash
# Find a booted simulator UDID
axe list-simulators
export UDID=<UDID>

# Inspect the current UI
axe describe-ui --udid "$UDID"

# Interact with the simulator
axe tap --label "Continue" --udid "$UDID"
axe type 'Hello world' --udid "$UDID"
axe screenshot --output ./screen.png --udid "$UDID"
```
