# Changelog

All notable changes to the AXe iOS testing framework will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added Claude Code and Codex plugin marketplaces for installing the bundled AXe skill.

## [v1.8.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- Added Xcode 27 and iOS 27 simulator automation through Device Hub without requiring Simulator.app, while retaining Xcode 26 support ([#60](https://github.com/cameroncooke/AXe/pull/60) by [@jkaunert](https://github.com/jkaunert)). See [Xcode compatibility](README.md#xcode-compatibility).

### Changed

- Strengthened release supply-chain integrity with immutable, verified IDB sources and stricter validation of release inputs and signing identities.

### Fixed

- Fixed BGRA video streams ignoring the requested `--fps` value and running at an uncapped frame rate.
- Fixed release archives failing strict Gatekeeper verification because of embedded filesystem metadata.
- Fixed commands exposing low-level simulator errors instead of actionable failure messages.

Various other internal improvements to stability, performance, and code quality.

## [v1.7.1] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Added AxePlayground alert, sheet, context menu, modal navigation, and long-scroll fixtures for UI automation regression coverage.

## [v1.7.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Added `axe slider --id/--label --value 0...100` for selector-based slider setting with orientation-aware HID dragging and AXValue tolerance verification/failure reporting.
- Added `axe drag --start-x/--start-y --end-x/--end-y` for raw point-to-point low-level HID drag validation using explicit touch move events.

### Changed

- Changed `axe slider` to use the shared composite low-level HID drag path with AXValue tolerance verification instead of retrying with correction gestures.

### Fixed

- Fixed `describe-ui` and selector-based `tap --label` exposing and activating real SwiftUI `TabView` tab items, navigation search fields, toolbar segmented picker items, and generated navigation back buttons from the CoreSimulator accessibility bridge. Also fixed selector decoding when the accessibility tree contains numeric `AXValue` fields such as sliders.
- Fixed `tap`, `touch`, `swipe`, and matching batch steps dispatching logical UI coordinates directly to FBSimulatorHIDEvent without landscape rotation or letterbox correction, causing interactions to land in the wrong location in rotated landscape simulators and portrait-hardware landscape-only apps. AXe now detects the simulator UI orientation automatically instead of requiring callers to pass landscape flags ([#5](https://github.com/cameroncooke/AXe/issues/5) by [@Nitewriter](https://github.com/Nitewriter))
- Fixed selector-based `tap` and batch tap steps so UIKit `UISwitch` and SwiftUI `Toggle` controls can be activated reliably, including when a matched row or label contains a single switch/toggle control. Added `--tap-style` so switch/toggle taps can use physical touch automatically while normal taps keep the simulator `tapAt` path by default ([#46](https://github.com/cameroncooke/AXe/pull/46)).
- Fixed element comparison in `AccessibilityTargetResolver` to prevent distinct elements with the same type and frame but lacking labels/values from being incorrectly identified as identical during ancestor tree traversal.

## [v1.6.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- Added `--value` targeting for `tap`, allowing elements to be matched by their accessibility value in addition to `--id` and `--label`. Added `--element-type` filtering to narrow matches by element type (e.g., button, text field) ([#40](https://github.com/cameroncooke/AXe/pull/40) by [@andresdefi](https://github.com/andresdefi)).
- Added `--wait-timeout` and `--poll-interval` options to `tap` for waiting until a matching element appears before tapping ([#40](https://github.com/cameroncooke/AXe/pull/40) by [@andresdefi](https://github.com/andresdefi)).

### Fixed

- Fixed `describe-ui` to expose and implement the documented `--point` option in command help and runtime behavior ([#38](https://github.com/cameroncooke/AXe/issues/38))

## [v1.5.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- Added `batch` command for executing ordered multi-step interaction workflows in a single invocation, with sequential execution that supports multi-screen flows, built-in `sleep` delays, accessibility caching, and configurable text submission strategies ([#25](https://github.com/cameroncooke/AXe/pull/25)). See [BATCHING.md](BATCHING.md).
- Added `axe init` command to install, uninstall, or print the AXe skill for AI clients (`claude`, `agents`) or a custom destination ([#25](https://github.com/cameroncooke/AXe/pull/25)).

### Fixed

- Fixed Homebrew installation on Intel Macs by producing architecture-specific release artifacts ([#27](https://github.com/cameroncooke/AXe/pull/27), [#21](https://github.com/cameroncooke/AXe/issues/21))
- Fixed `tap --label` resolving ambiguous matches by preferring actionable elements over read-only ones ([#28](https://github.com/cameroncooke/AXe/pull/28))

## [v1.4.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- AxePlayground Touch Control now shows long-press count and last long-press coordinates, making gesture automation easier to validate.

### Fixed

- Improved long-press reliability for `axe touch`: `--down --up --delay` now consistently behaves like a real press-and-hold gesture.

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-01-28

- Add `key-combo` command for atomic modifier+key presses (e.g., Cmd+A, Cmd+Shift+Z) Thanks to @jpsim for the contribution!
